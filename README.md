# Car-Prices

This notebook contains code for scraping car listings from the Cars.com and Sahibinden.com (a Turkish website) and conducts a short analysis on the car prices. The fair car prices are estimated using a linear regression model. There is additional analysis of the descriptions in the listings to identify the factors that affect the car prices but are otherwise not apparent in the listing.
